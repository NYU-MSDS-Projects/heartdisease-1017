# Responsible Data Science Final Project
Pedro Galarza and Jack Epstein

This is the repo for our final project for NYU's Responsible Data Science Class. In the project we explore the implementation of and automated decision system (ADS) on Kaggle and evaluate this system for it's fairness and transparency.

## Current repo structure:

#### Kaggle:
- This contains the main dataset and the ADS we are analyzing

#### Original Code:
- This contains anything we built, from EDA to deep dives into the ADS
- All .ipynb files are meant to be read using Google Collab notebooks
